# Instagram Clone
## üìå Introduction

This is the clone of Instagram. You can share your images with your followers and engage with their posts too!

This Project has been created solely for the assignment purpose of the Interview process for a Software Engineering Intern position.

### Front-End - React + Bootstrap

### Back-End - Node.js(Express.js) & MongoDB

## Tech Stack

### Front-end

-   The front-end client is built as a simple-page-application using React and Redux (for middlewares and reducers).
-   React-Router is used for navigation.
-   Bootstrap 4 is used for page styling.

### Back-end

-   The back-end server is built with Express.js and Node.js in MVC pattern, which provides completed REST APIs for data interaction.
-   Passport.js is used as an authentication middleware in the sever.
-   JSON Web Token (JWT) is used for signing in user and making authenticated requests.

### Database

-   MongoDB is used as the back-end database, which include different data models/schemas (i.e., User, Post and Comment).
-   Mongoose is used to access the MongoDB for CRUD actions (create, read, update and delete).

## ‚≠ê How to get started on local system?
1. Drop a ‚≠ê on the Github Repository.
2. Clone the Repo by going to your local Git Client and pushing in the command:
git clone https://github.com/sagar-barapatre/mern-assignment.git
3. Now, push in the command under Instagram-Clone/Server directory which will install all the dependencies of the project:
`npm install`
4. Run this command to start the backend of the application:
`node app.js`
5. Now, head over to 'client' directory and run this command to start the frontend of the application: `npm start`

##  ‚≠ê Set-Up Project in your machine

1.  Fork the repo and clone it.
2.  Create a new branch.
3.  Make sure you have  `npm`  Node.js installed in your system. MongoAtlas is used, so no need for local MongoDB setup.
4.  MongoAtlas Setup  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M&feature=youtu.be&t=293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M&feature=youtu.be&t=293)  
5. Set up your `.env` file and paste in the URI that you get from following the instructions in the video above. Also set token secret to anything, it is used for jwt authentication.

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<dbUser>:<password>@cluster0-m5jph.gcp.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
TOKEN=your secret key
```

You need to remember to paste in the and . Do NOT share it publicly, and do NOT include the .env file in commits.

5.  [Only once] Run (from the Server)  `npm install`  and  `cd client && npm install`.
6.  Open two terminal windows (one for running Server and other for the Frontend).
7.  To run server, from Server directory run  `npm run dev`  and to run client, go to client directory and run  `npm run start`.
8.  Go to  `https://localhost:3000`  to see the application running. (Anyways it will automatically open the new tab and display the UI).

## Deploying to Heroku

1.  To deploy your application to Heroku, you must have a Heroku account.
2.  Go to  [their page](https://www.heroku.com/)  to create an account. Then go through their documention on how to create a Heroku app. Also check out the  [documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)  on Heroku CLI.

### Create a Heroku App

First, login to Heroku:
```
heroku login
```

This will redirect you to a URL in the browser where you can log in. Once you're finished you can continue in the terminal.

In the same React project directory, run the following:
```
heroku create
```
This will create a Heroku application and also give you the URL to access the application.

### Configure package.json

Heroku uses your package.json file to know which scripts to run and which dependencies to install for your project to run successfully.

In your  `package.json`  file, add the following:

```
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "start": "node Server/app.js",
        "heroku-postbuild": "NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false npm install npm && run build"
    },
    ...
    "engines": {
        "node": "10.16.0"
    }
}
```

Heroku runs a post build, which as you can see installs your dependencies and runs a build of your React project. Then it starts your project with the start script which basically starts your server. After that, your project should work fine.

`engines`  specifies the versions of engines like  `node`  and  `npm`  to install.

### Push to Heroku

```
git push heroku master
```

This pushes your code to Heroku. Remember to include unnecessary files in  `.gitignore`.

After few seconds your site will be ready. If there are any errors, you can check your terminal or go to your dashboard in the browser to view the build logs.

Now you can preview your site at the URL Heroku sent when you ran  `heroku create`.
